# The Homer Multitext project archive

This is the central repository for archival data from the Homer Multitext project.


## What's in this repository

- `archive`: all published releases are machine-generated and validated from content in the [archive](./archive) directory
- `release-candidates`: staging directory for publication of the archive as a single CEX file.  Release candidates need further validation prior to publication in the `releases-cex` directory.
- `releases-cex`:  complete, validated releases of the archive as a single CEX file. The file name convention is that each release is named `hmt-YYYYC` where `YYYY` is the four-digit year, and `C` is a sequentially applied alphabetic character.
- `iiif`: IIIF Presentation Manifests automatically built from the most recent published CEX release of the archive.

Notes on the contents and level of validation applied to each release are in [releases-cex/releases.md](./releases-cex/releases.md)
